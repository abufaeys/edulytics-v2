## Description

Edulytics-V2 is a webapp targetted at 2 main stakeholders Students and Educators. Our objective is to enhance their learning and teaching capabilities.

#### Student

The theme for the students is <b> Gamification </b>. As a Student we have identified that, what they are most concerned about is where they stand in class, and if they are lagging behind. Our application revolves around the <b> Elo Rating </b> and <b> Attribute System </b>, an idea inspired by games like DOTA. We want to enable student to track, analyze and be aware of their standings in class. But at the same time, too much competitiveness may result in demoralization of weaker students. We plan to strike this balance between competition and motivation by applying a layer of abstraction through gamification.

#### Educators

The theme for Educator is <b>Superpowers</b>. As an educator we identified that the biggest challenge is to understand students, as they are unique. Our application allows educators to have a <b>overview</b> of all the students in their course and the ability to drill down on students who have red flags. The educators also have to ability to <b>monitor class activities</b> such as assignments and online YouTube tutorials, they will have the ability to see who does and watches them. Through our application, we want to enable educators to know each and everyone of their students, enhancing their ability to teach and guide them.
